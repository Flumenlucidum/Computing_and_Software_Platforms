# Computing_and_Software_Platforms

In order to handle large number of cases and objects, so called big data, knowledge about computing skills and efficient algorithm is mandatory. I could improve my computing skills by understanding data structures, algorithms, and computer architecture including GPU. It was a great opportunity to figure out how the ideas in statistics and econometrics are run behind the computing system.
